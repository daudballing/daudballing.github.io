Hi!

"Wuuh, you did it - great!". Speaking to yourself is certainly okay if nobody notice or hears you while doing it. Unfortunately, I'm enjoying the company of my girlfriend while I got this baby, the <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog, up and running for the first time.

I have been thinking for some time now to begin my own personal blog, for a few main purposes. That is, to be able to assess more clearly the progress I'm doing in my work, stuff from school and to set some goals for further achievements.

The idea behind this blog came from a visit at Adam Kaplan's <a href="http://www.adamkaplan.me/">site</a>. He uses his site to write about his learning progress and shows some of his projects as well. Go check his stuff!

<div class="row clearfix">
	<div class ="column full">
		<h2>Topics I'm considering posting on:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ruby</li>
			<li>QlikView</li>
			<li>Webdesign</li>
			<li>Business and IT</li>
			<li>Data Visualization</li>
			<li>Management and Organization</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
<i>Please note that this site is under heavy influence of both steep learning curves and challenges and may be subject to incorrect use of code/language/imagination/thoughts/expressions/etc./this-is-beginning-to-look-like-a-folder-structure - but for now this is what this site can offer.</i>

Sites of inspiration that got me going with Jekyll includes:
<ul>
	<li>Adam Kaplan // <a href="http://www.adamkaplan.me/">adamkaplan.me</a></li>
	<li>Andrew Munsell // <a href="http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/">learn.andrewmunsell.com/</a></li>
	<li>Jekyll // <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">http://jekyllrb.com/</a></li>
</ul>
